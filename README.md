# Getting access to the Alexa homebridge-alexa homeskill beta

Send me a direct message via slack / Homebridge at NorthernMan54 with your amazon login.  I will then enroll yourself into the beta.

# Alexa Home Skill configuration

1. To enable Alexa Homeskill account linking you need to create an account for yourself at https://homebridge.cloudwatch.net

2. Search for the homebridge skill on the Alexa App/Web site, and link you Amazon account to the account you created above.

# Homebridge Installation

The setup of this is very straight forward, and requires enabling insecure mode of each homebridge instance you want to control from Alexa.

1. All homebridge instances that you want to control from Alexa need to run in insecure
mode with -I included on the command line.  How you make this change will depend on your installation of homebridge, and how you start homebridge.  If you start from the command line, it would look like this:

```
homebridge -I
```

2. Set this up as a usual plugin, except it doesn't have any devices ;-)  I'm just
reusing the runtime and configuration file management. And it only needs to installed once if you have multiple homeridge's installed.  It will autodiscover the others.
```
sudo npm install -g https://github.com/NorthernMan54/homebridge-alexa#Alexa2ndGen
```

In the event of issues or errors during install ie gyp WARN EACCES user "root" does not have permission to access the dev dir

Please try this instead

```
sudo su
sudo npm install -g â€”unsafe-perm https://github.com/NorthernMan54/homebridge-alexa#Alexa2ndGen
```

3. Login and password in the config.json, are the credentials you created earlier for the https://homebridge.cloudwatch.net website.

4. Restart homebridge, and ask Alexa to discovery devices.
